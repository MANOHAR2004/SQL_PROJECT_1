# SQL Portfolio Project 1: Library Management System 📚

**End-to-end MySQL database design, implementation, and advanced analysis**

A complete relational database for a library that tracks authors, books, members, and borrowing history — built with realistic data (including Indian literature) and 10 practical business queries.

### 🎯 Project Highlights
- Relational database design with normalization (3NF) and foreign key constraints  
- Realistic data population (English + Hindi literature authors)  
- 10 real-world business queries demonstrating advanced SQL skills  
- Clean, readable, and production-ready code

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Skills Demonstrated**:  
  - Database design & ER diagramming  
  - Multi-table JOINs (2–4 tables)  
  - Aggregates, GROUP BY, HAVING  
  - Date functions (DATEDIFF), string functions (CONCAT)  
  - COUNT(DISTINCT), anti-joins (LEFT JOIN + IS NULL)  
  - Business reporting logic (fines, trends, optimization)

### 📊 Key Business Queries (All 10 included in library.sql)
1. Currently borrowed books report  
2. Overdue books with days late  
3. Top 5 most borrowed books  
4. Inactive members (never borrowed)  
5. Authors ranked by total borrows  
6. Books that have never been borrowed  
7. Heavy borrowers (>3 active books)  
8. Potential fine revenue calculation (₹10/day overdue)  
9. Monthly borrowing trend analysis  
10. Members with the most diverse authors (COUNT DISTINCT)

### 🏗️ ER Diagram

**Relationships**:
- One Author → Many Books (1:N)  
- One Book → Many Borrows (1:N)  
- One Member → Many Borrows (1:N)

### 📈 Sample Business Insights
- **Revenue opportunity**: ₹150–₹300+ potential fines from overdue books (Jan 2026)  
- **Stock optimization**: Several books with 3–5 copies have zero borrows → candidates for promotion or removal  
- **Reader engagement**: Top members borrowed from 5+ different authors → ideal for personalized recommendations

### How to Run the Project
1. Create database: `CREATE DATABASE sql_portfolio_database;.`
2. Use MySQL Workbench / CLI / phpMyAdmin
3. Run full script: `library.sql` (contains schema + data + all queries)
4. Explore the results of the 10 queries

### Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Window functions for rankings and running totals  
- Triggers for automatic fine tracking  
- Integration with Python (Pandas) or Power BI for visualization
